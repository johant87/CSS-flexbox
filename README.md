# CSS-flexbox

With the ever increasing need for responsive websites CSS3 standards finally seem to be able up for the task by new standards such as Flexbox and grids. My curiosity towards responsive technology brought me to try out Flexbox. This is a simple example with flexbox. I quickly discovered using this method how easy it is to create responsive layouts. It is very likely your browser needs to be up to date in order for this demo to work.
